Alright. Here's what we need to do:

Get Google Places Details data.
	
Put it into the Places Div.


Get Instagram Data.

Put it in the Instagram Div.

Issues:
How do I get the data from Google?
Can I use places with a static map?

New things:
the data can be accessed client side through the google maps API.

I spent a long time today chasing the server side API, to no avail. Ha. However, I was able to pin down the uses of teh client side api, and I think I've figured out how to make it happen.

I need to figure out how to access the places data. Then I can put that data in a div.

Next, I need to figure out how to center the map and how to draw maps between markers.

Where I left off:
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE DATA FROM THE PLACES DETAILS LIST
