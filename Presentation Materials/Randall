Hey there and welcome to Night LYFE, when the product was described to me I instantly thought of UrbanSpoon and wondered if we could bring some semblance of that functionality to this project. In my mindâ€™s eye I instantly had the idea of Austin at night and wanted that to be the main image. 

I my role on the team was to be the visual and UX designer as well. From large splashy fonts to copper buttons I wanted everything to feel like Austin at night and hopefully the user feels the same when they use the product. Each time I looked at the page a new idea would leap out at me and challenge me to find a way to implement it into the overall design. I would have to say that my biggest challenge was figuring out a way to hide and show a div element and for every step closer I thought I got defeat was just around the corner. It wasn't until last night that I finally solved the issue and man I tell you that is one hell of a feeling of triumph.
